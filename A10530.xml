            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>And therefore was it that ſome did account the heade of a man the greateſt miracle in the worlde, becauſe not onely of the ſtraunge workemanſhippe that is in it, but much more of the efficacie of reaſon, witte, memorie, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and ſuch other powers and works of the mind, which can more eaſily conceiue any thing in a manner, than vnderſtande it ſelfe.

And although the ignorant ſort (which hate all things that they knowe not) doe little eſteeme the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundneſſe of mans ſpirit and of reaſon, the chiefe power and facultie of it, yet as there is a kind of feare and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of vnreaſonable beaſtes vnto man by the working power of God, ſo is there in thoſe ſmall reaſoned perſons a certaine kinde of reuerence towarde wiſedome and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſons, which they doe ſhewe oftentimes, and by power of perſuaſion are inforced to obey reaſon, will they nil they.</p>

to them which loue but little, and care much leſſe for the knowledge of reaſon, but vnto your Maieſtie (I dare ſay) it is a delectable remembrance, and vnto mee it ſeemed ſo pleaſant, that I coulde ſcarſe ſtaye my penne from writing all that mine eyes did ſo greedily reade.</p>
                  <p>This ſentence of <hi>Cicero</hi> am I lothe to tranſlate into Engliſhe, partly for that vnto your Maieſtie it needeth no tranſlation, but eſpecially knowing howe farre that grace of <hi>Tullies</hi> eloquence doth excell any Engliſh mans tongue, and much more exceedeth the baſeneſſe of my bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous ſtyle, yet for the fruite of the ſentence, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto my meere Engliſh Countrymen vtter the rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of my tranſlation, than to defraud them of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of ſo good a leſſon, truſting they will alſo gladly and greedily imbrace all good ſciences that may helpe to the iuſt furniture of the ſame, when they conſider that infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med reaſon was the onely Inſtrument, or ar leaſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe meane to bring men vnto Ciuile regiment, from barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous manners and beaſtly conditions.</p>
                  <p>For the time was (ſaith Tullie) that men wandered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the fields vp and downe like beaſts, and vſed no better order in feeding than they, ſo that by reaſons rule they wrought nothing, but moſte of their doing did they atchiue by force of ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth. At this time there was no iuſt regarde of religion towarde God, nor of duetie towarde man. No man had ſeene right vſe of mariage, neither did any man knowe their owne children from other, nor no man had felt the commodity of iuſt lawes: ſo that through errour and ignorance, wilfull luſt, like a blinde and heady ruler, abuſed bodily ſtrength as a moſt mortall miniſter for the ſatiſfying of his deſire. At that time was there one, which not onely in power, but alſo in wiſedome was great: and he conſidered, howe that in the mindes of men was bothe apte inſtrumentes, and greate occaſion to the
<pb facs="tcp:2279:6"/>
due accompliſhment of moſt weightie affaires, if a man coulde applie them to vſe, and by teaching of rules frame them to better trade. This man with perſuaſion of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, gathered into one place the people that were wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring about the fieldes, and lay lurking in wilde cotages and woods: And bringing them into one common ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, did trade them to all ſuch things, as either were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable or honeſt, although not without repyning at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt, by reaſon that they had not beene ſo accuſtomed before. Yet at length through reaſon and perſuaſion of wordes they obeyed him more diligently, and ſo of a wilde and cruell people, he made them curteous and gentle.</p>
                  <p>Thus hath <hi>Tullie</hi> ſet forth the efficacie of reaſon and perſuaſion, howe it was able to conuert wilde people to a mildeneſſe, and to change their furious cruelneſſe into gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:2279:7"/>
and ſundrie other vſes, thoſe were Arithmerike and Geometrie. Againe, to incourage men to the honour of God, they taught Aſtronomie, whereby the wonderfull workes of God were ſo manifeſtly ſet forth, that no mans tongue nor pen can in like ſort expreſſe his infinite pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, his vnſpeakable wiſedome, and his exceeding good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe toward man, wherby he doth bauntifully prouide for man all neceſſaries, not onely to liue, but alſo to liue plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly. And ſo was their confidence in Gods prouidence ſtrongly ſtayed, knowing his goodneſſe to be ſuch, that he woulde helpe man as he coulde, and his power to bee ſo great, that he could doe what he woulde: and thirdly his wiſedome to be ſo pure, that he would doe nothing, but that was beſt. Beſide theſe Sciences they taught alſo Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſike, which moſt commonly they did apply partely to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Sciences, to drawe men to delight therein, &amp; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſongs made of the maners of men in praiſe of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and diſcommendation of Vice, whereby it came to paſſe, that no man would diſpleaſe them, nor do any thing euill that might come to their hearing:<note place="margin">This Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Drui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius the v. king of the Celtes, raig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned 69. yeres, and died 1832. yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt.</note> for their Songs did make euill men more abhorred in that time, than any excommunication doeth in this time.

                  <p>And as theſe Sciences did encreaſe, ſo did vertue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thereby. Againe, as theſe ſciences did decaye, ſo vertue loſt hir eſtimation, and conſequently was little in vſe: whereof to make a ful declaration, were a thing meet for a Prince to heare, but it woulde require a peculiar treatiſe. Wherefore at this preſent I count it ſufficient lightly to haue touched this matter in generall wordes, and to ſay no more of the particularitie thereof, but onely touching one of thoſe ſciences, that is, Arithmetike, by
<pb facs="tcp:2279:7"/>
which not onely iuſt partition of landes was made, but alſo touching buying an ſelling, all aſſiſes, weights, and meaſures were deuiſed, and all reckenings and accounts driuen: yea by proportion of it, were the true orders of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice limited, as (<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Ethikes doth declare) &amp; the degrees of eſtates in the common wealth eſtabliſhed. Although that proportion be called Geometricall, and not Arithmeticall, yet doth that proportion appertaine to the Art of Arithmetike: &amp; in Arithmetike is taught the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of ſuch proportions, and all things thereto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing. Wherefore I may well ſay, that ſeeing Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metike is ſo many wayes needefull vnto the firſt planting of a common wealth, it muſt needes be as much required to the preſeruation of it alſo: for by the ſame meanes is any common wealth continued, by which it was erected and eſtabliſhed. And if I ſhall in ſmal matters in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but in deede verie waightie, put one example or two, what ſhall we ſay for the ſtatutes of this realme, which be the onely ſtaie of good order in maner nowe? As touching the meſuring of ground by length and bredth, there is a good and an auncient ſtatute made by Arte of Arithmetike, and now it ſhalbe to little vſe, if by the ſame Art it be not practiſed and tried. For the aſſyſe of breade and drinke, the two moſt common and moſt neceſſarie thinges for the ſuſtentation of man, there was a goodly ordinance in the Lawe made, which by ignorance hath ſo growen out of knowledge and vſe, that fewe men doe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it, and therefore the ſtatute bookes wonderfully corrupted, &amp; the commons cruelly oppreſſed: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſome me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue written, that it is too doubtful a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to execute thoſe Aſſiſes by thoſe ſtatutes, by reaſon they depend of the ſtanderd of the coine, whiche is muche chaunged from the ſtate of that time when thoſe ſtatutes were made. Thus ſhall euerie man reade that liſteth in
<pb facs="tcp:2279:8"/>
the Abridgement of Statutes in the title of Waightes and Meaſures, in the ſeauenth number of the Engliſhe Booke, where hee ſhoulde haue tranſlated a good ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which is ſet forth in the French booke: but no maruaile if the Abridgement doth omit it, ſeeing the great booke of Statutes doth omitte the ſame Statute, as it hath done diuers other verie good lawes. And this is the fruite of ignorance, to reiect all that it vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not, although they vſe ſome clokes for it: but ſuch clokes, as being allowed, might ſerue to repell all good lawes, which God forbid.</p>
                  <p>Againe there is an auncient order for aſſiſe of fyre wood, and coales, which was renued not many yeares paſt, and nowe howe Auarice and Ignorance doth canuas the ſtatute, it is too pitifull to talke of, and more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to feele.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, for the Statute of Coinage, and the ſtanderd thereof, if the people vnderſtoode rightly the ſtatute, they ſhoulde not, nor woulde not (as they often doe) gather an excuſe for their follie therby, but as I ſaid, theſe ſtatutes by wiſedome and good knowledge of Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metike were made, &amp; by the ſame muſt they be continued. And let Ignorance no more meddle with the vſe of them, than it did with the making of them. Oh in how miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble caſe is that Realme, where the Miniſters and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of the Lawes are deſtitute of all good ſciences, which be the keyes of the laws?

                  <head>TO THE LOVING Reader. The Preface of Maiſter Ro: RECORD.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>ORE oftetimes haue I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with my ſelfe the infortunate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> ſeeing ſo many great Clerks to ariſe in ſundrie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partes of the world, and ſo few to appeare in this our nation: whereas for preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancie of naturall witte (I thinke) few nations doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell Engliſh men: But I cannot impute the cauſe to any other thing than to the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt or miſſeregard of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. For as Engliſhmen are inferior to no men in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther witte, ſo they paſſe all men in vaine pleaſures, to which they may attaine with great paine or labour: and are as ſlacke to any, neuer ſo great commoditie, if there hang of it any paineful ſtudie or trauelſome labour.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, yet all men are not of that ſort, though the moſt part be, the more pitie it is: but of them that are ſo glad, not onlie with paineful ſtudie and ſtudious paine to attaine learning, but alſo with as great ſtudie &amp; paine to communicate their learning to others, and make all England, if it might be, partakers of the ſame, the moſte part are ſuche, that vnneth they can ſupport their owne
<pb facs="tcp:2279:10"/>
neceſſarie charges, ſo that they are not able to beare any charges in doing of that good, that elſe they deſire to do.</p>
                  <p>But a greater cauſe of lamentation is this: that when learned men haue taken paines to do things for the aide of the vnlearned, ſcarce they ſhall be allowed for their wel doing, but derided and ſcorned, and ſo vtterlye diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to take in hand any like enterprice againe. So that if any be founde (as there are ſome) that do fauour learning and learned wittes, and can bee content to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knowledge, yea only with their word, ſuch perſons, though they bee rare, yet ſhall they encourage learned men to enterpriſe ſome things, at the leaſt, that Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d may reioice of. And I haue good hope that England wil (after ſhe hath taken ſome ſure taſte of learning) not only bring forth more fauorers of it, but alſo ſuch lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, that ſhe ſhall bee able to compare with anie realme in the world. But in the meane ſeaſon, where ſo few regarders of learning are, how greatly they are to be eſteemed that doe fauour and further it, my penne wyll not ſuffice at ful to declare.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, gentle reader, where as I doe vppon moſte iuſt occaſion iudge, yea and know aſſuredlie, that there be ſome men in this realme, which both loue, and alſo much deſire to further good learning, and yet am not well able to write their condigne praiſe for the ſame, I thinke it better with ſilence to ouerpaſſe it, then eyther to ſay too little of it, or to prouoke againſte them the malice of ſuche other, which do nothing themſelues that is praiſe worthie, and therfore can not abide to heare the praiſe of any other mans good deede.</p>
                  <p>And conſidering their greate fauour vnto learning, though I my ſelfe be not worthie to be reckoned in the number of great learned men, yet am I bolde to put my ſelfe in preace with ſuch abilitie, as God hath lent mee
<pb facs="tcp:2279:10"/>
thoughe not with ſo greate cunning as manye men, yet with as great affection as any man, to help my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and wil not ceaſe dayly, (as much as my ſmall abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie wil ſuffer me) to endite ſome ſuch thing, that ſhall be to the inſtruction, though not of learned men. yet at the leaſt of the vulgare ſort, whoſe argument alwayes ſhall be ſuch, that it ſhall delight al learned wits, though they do not learne any great things out of it.</p>
                  <p>But to ſpeake of this preſent Booke of Arithmetick, I dare not nor wil not ſet it foorth with any words, but remit it to the iudgement of all gentle readers, &amp; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſuch as loue good learning, beſeeching them ſo to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme it, as it doth ſeeme worthie. And ſo either to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the thing for it ſelfe, either at the leaſte to allowe my good endeauour. But I perceiue I neede not vſe anye perſuaſions vnto them, whoſe gentle nature and fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable minde is readie to receiue thankefullye, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preate to the beſt, of al ſuche enterprices attempted for lo good an ende, though the thing do not alwayes ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie mens expectation.</p>
                  <p>This conſidered, did bolden me to publiſh abroade this little Booke of the Arte of numbring, which if you ſhal receiue fauourablie, you ſhal encourage me to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie you hereafter with ſome greater thing.</p>
                  <p>And as I iudge ſome menne of ſo louing a minde to their natiue countrey that they woulde much reioyce to ſee it to proſper in good learning and wittie Artes, ſo I hope well of all the reſt of Engliſhmen, that they wyl not be vnmindeful of his due praiſe, by whoſe meanes they are helped and furthered in anye thing. Neither ought to eſteeme this thing of ſo little value, as manye men of little diſcretion oftentimes do: For who ſo ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſmall price by the wittie deuiſe and knowlege of numbring, he little conſidereth it to be the chiefe point (in manner) wherby men differ from all bruite beaſtes:
<pb facs="tcp:2279:11"/>
for as in al other things, (almoſt) beaſtes are partakers with vs, ſo in numbring we differ cleane from them, and in manner peculiarlie, fith that in manie things they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel vs againe.</p>

                  <p>Many things elſe of the wittineſſe of beaſts &amp; byrdes might I heere ſaye, ſaue that another time I entende to write wherein they excel in manner all men, as it is day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſeene: but in number was there neuer beaſt found ſo cunning, that coulde know or diſcerne one thing from manye, as by daylie experience you may well conſider, when a Bitch hath manie whelpes, or a Hen many Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens: and likewiſe of other whatſoeuer they be, take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them al their yong, ſauing onlie one, and you ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue plainly, that they miſſe none, though they wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt you in taking them away, and wil ſeeke them again if they may know where they bee, but elſe they wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer miſſe hem truelye, but take awaie that one that is
<pb facs="tcp:2279:11"/>
left, and then wil they crie and complaine: and reſtore to them that one, then are they pleaſed againe: ſo that of nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber this may I iuſtlie ſay, It is the only thing (almoſt) that ſeparateth man from beaſtes. He therefore that ſhal contemne number, he declareth himſelfe as brutiſh as a beaſt, and vnworthy to be counted in felowſhip of men. But I truſt there is no man ſo foule ouerſeene, thoughe manie right ſmallie do it regarde.</p>
                  <p>Therefore wil I now ſtay to write againſt ſuche, and returne againe to this booke, whiche I haue written in the forme of a Dialogue, bicauſe I iudge that to bee the eaſieſt way of inſtruction, when the Scholer may aske e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie doubt orderlie, and the maiſter may anſwer to his queſtion plainelie.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit I thinke not the contrary, but as it is eaſier to blame an other mans worke than to make the lyke, ſo there wil be ſome that wil finde fault, bicauſe I write in a Dialogue: but as I coniecture, thoſe ſhal be ſuche, as doe not, cannot, either will not perceiue the reaſon of right teaching and therefore are vnmeete to be aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto, for ſuch men with no reaſon wil be ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>And if any man obiect that other bookes haue bene written of Arithmetike alreadie ſo ſufficientlie, that I needed not now to put pen to the booke, except I will condemn other mens writings: to them I aunſwer. That as I condemne no mans diligence, ſo I know that no one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can ſatiſfie euerie man, and therefore like as manye do eſteme greatly other Bookes, ſo I doubt not but ſome wil like this my Booke aboue any other Engliſh Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metike hitherto wrtiten, and namely ſuch as ſhall lacke inſtructers, for whoſe ſake I haue ſo plainely ſet foorthe the examples, as no Booke (that I haue ſeene) hath done hitherto: whyche thing ſhall bee greate eaſe to the rude readers.</p>
                  <p>Therefore gentle reader, though this booke can bee
<pb facs="tcp:2279:12"/>
ſmall aide to the learned ſorte, yet vnto the ſimple ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant (which needeth moſt help) it may be a good fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance and meane vnto knowledge. And though vnto the King his Maieſtie priuatelye I doe it dedicate, yet I doubt not (ſuche is his clemencie) but that hee can bee content, yea and much deſirous, that all his louing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects ſhal take the vſe of it, and employ the ſame to their moſt profit: Which thing if I perceiue that they thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie do, and receiue with as good will as it was written, then wil I ſhortly with no leſſe kindneſſe ſet forth ſuche introductions in to Geometry and Coſmography, as I haue at other times promiſed, and as hitherto in Engliſh hath not bene enterpriſed, wherwith I dare ſay al honeſt heartes wil be pleaſed, and all ſtudious wittes greatlye delighted.</p>
                  <p>I wil ſay no more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but let euerie man iudge as he ſhal ſee cauſe. And thus for this time I will ſtaye my penne, committing you all to that true fountaine of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect number, which wrought the whole world by number and meaſure: he is Trinitie in Vnitie, and Vnitie in Trinitie: To whom be all praiſe, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and glorie.

                        <p>Fyrſte (as you recken them) Muſicke hath not only greate healpe of Arithmetike, but is made, and hath his perfectneſſe of it: for all Muſicke ſtandeth by Number &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>

                        <p>And as for the Lawe, it is playne, that the man that is ignorant of Arithmetike, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther méete to be a Iudge, neyther an Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, nor yet a Proctour. For howe can hée wel vnderſtande another mannes cauſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayning to diſtribution of goods, or other dettes, or of ſummes of money, if he bée ignorante of Arithmetike? This oftentimes cauſeth righte to be hindered, when the Iudge either deliteth not to heare of a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he peceyueth not, or cannot Iudge it for lacke of vnderſtanding: This commeth by the ignoraunce of Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Nowe as for Grammer, mée thinketh you ſhoulde not doubte in what it néedeth number, ſith you haue learned that Nounes of al ſorts, Pronouns, Verbs, &amp; Participles, are diſtinct diuerſly by Numbers: beſides the varietie of Nounes of Numbre, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbs. And if you take away Number from Grammer, then is all the quantitie of Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables loſte. And manye other wayes dothe Number helpe Grammer. Whereby were al kindes of meters found and made? Was it not by Number?</p>

                           <pb facs="tcp:2279:20"/>But howe néedefull Arithmetike is to all parts of Philoſophie, they may ſoone ſée, that doe reade eyther <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato,</hi> or anye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Philoſophers writing.

                        <p>There are reckened commonlye ſeauen partes or workes of it.</p>
                        <p>Numeration, Addition, Subtraction, Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication Diuiſion, Progreſſion, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of rootes: to theſe ſome men adde Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, Triplation, and Mediation. But as for theſe laſte thrée, they are contained vnder the other ſeauen. For Duplation and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, are contained vnder Multiplication, as it ſhall appeare in their place.

                           <p>Euen ſo: but yet adde Order to them as the fourth. And firſte marke, that there are but tenne figures, that are vſed in Arithmetike: and of thoſe tenne, one doth ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing, whiche is made like an 0, and is called priuately a Cyphre, thoughe all the

                           <p>But here muſte you marke, that euery Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure hathe two values: One alwayes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that it ſignifieth properly, which it hath of his forme: and the other vncertaine, which he taketh of his place.</p>
                           <p>A Place is called the ſeate or roome that a Figure ſtandeth in.

                           <p>It is the laſte value or name ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to any ſumme. As when I ſaye: CC.xxii. pounds: pounds is the Denomination. And likewiſe in ſaying: as men, men is the Denomination, and ſo of other. But in this place (that I ſpake of before) the laſte number of euery Ternarie, is the Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of it. As of the firſt Ternarie, the denomination is vnites, and of the ſeconde. Ternarie, the Denomination is thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandes: and of the thirde Ternarie, thouſand

thouſandes, or millions: of the iiij. thouſande thouſand thouſandes, or thouſande Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and ſoforth.</p>

                           <p>And what ſhall I call the value of the iij. figures that maye bée pronounced before the Denominators? as in ſaying: 203 000000, that is CCiij. millions. I perceyue by youre wordes, that millions is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination: but what ſhal I call the CCiij. ioyned before the Millions?</p>

                           <p>I might here ſhew you who were the firſte inuentors of this Arte, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all theſe things that I haue taughte you, but that wil I reſerue till ye haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ouer all the practiſe of this Arte, leaſte I ſhoulde trouble your witte, with ouer many things at the firſte.</p>
                           <p>But yet this muſte you marke, that there are thrée kindes of number: one called Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gits, an other articles, and the thirde mixte
<pb facs="tcp:2279:29"/>
numbers.</p>
                           <p>A Digit is any number vnder 10, as this: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
                           <p>And 10 with al other that maye be diuided into tenne parts iuſt, and nothing remaine, are called Articles: ſuche are 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, &amp;c. 100, 200, &amp;c. 1000. &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>And that number is called mixt, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth Articles, or at the leaſte one article, and a digit: as 12, 16, 19, 21, 38, 107, 1005. and ſo forth. And for the more eaſe of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and remembraunce marke this: The diget number is neuer written wyth more than one figure, but the article and the mixt number are euer wrytten wyth more than one figure. And thus they differ, that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle hathe euermore this Cyphre <hi>c,</hi> in the firſte place: and the mixte number hathe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer there ſome Diget.</p>

                           <p>If you remember nowe all that I haue ſayde, you haue learned ſufficientlye this firſte kinde of Arithmetike, called Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration, Howbeit, I will yet exhorte you
<pb facs="tcp:2279:30"/>
nowe, to remember bothe this that I haue ſaide, and all that I ſhall ſaye, and to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe your ſelfe in the practiſe of it: For Rules without practiſe, are but a light knowledge: and practiſe it is, that maketh menne perfect and prompt in all things.</p>
                           <p>And as you haue learned to gather and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the value of a ſumme propounded, and ſet downe before you: ſo muſte you practiſe to marke note, or write downe, with apte fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and in due places, any number, onely named or recited to you, or of your ſelfe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined: as for a proofe: How note you, or write downe this ſumme, fiue thouſande, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth, fiftie and ſeuen.</p>

                           <p>This troubleth me nowe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhoulde beginne at the firſte figure or at the laſt. For reaſon (me thinketh) ſhould cauſe me to beginnne at the firſte: and yet if I write it as you ſpeake it, I muſte beginne at the laſte.</p>

                           <p>When you knowe youre places perfectly, you maye beginne where you liſt. But the more eaſe for your hande is to begin with the laſte, that is to ſay, as I did ſpeake them. Yet for the more ſuretie, a while you maye beginne with the firſte, repeating my
<pb facs="tcp:2279:30"/>
wordes backewarde thus: Seauen, Fiftie, two hundreth, fiue thouſande: or elſe ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them all by their diget or valewer, as thus: ſeauen, fiue, two, fiue: for that way is eaſieſt. But then muſte you looke wel, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any Ciphre in your ſumme that he may be ſette in his place. As if youre laſt valewer of youre ſumme (as you ſpeake it) be aboue 9, then is there a Cyphre in the firſt place. And if it be a hundred or aboue, then is there two Cyphres one in the firſt place, &amp; an other in the ſeconde, and ſo forth.</p>

                           <p>I ſaide indéede, that you ſhoulde write that vnder them, that did reſulte of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

both togither: which ſaying is alwayes true, if that ſumme do not excéede a Digit. But if it be a mixte number, then muſte you write the Digit of it vnder your figures, as I haue ſaid before: but and if it be an Article, then write 0 vnder them, and in both ſortes you ſhall kepe the article in your mind. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when you haue added your ſeconde fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, which occupy the place of tennes, you ſhall put that 1 therto, which you kept in your minde: for though it were ten indéede, yet in that place it is but as one, becauſe, that euerie 1 of that place, is ten, for it is the place of tens. And in like manner: if you haue in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place ſo great a number, that it amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth aboue 9, then write the digite, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the article in your mind, euer adding it to the next place following: and ſo of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, how many ſo euer you haue. And if you haue a mixt number, when you haue added your laſt figures, then write the digit vnder the laſt figures, and the article in the next place beyond them: ſo ſhall your number reſulting of Addition, haue one place more than the numbers which you ſhould adde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:2279:35"/>
reaſon of this is, (as I vnderſtande) becauſe that no one place can contain aboue 9, which is the greateſt figure that is, and then all tens or articles muſt be put to the next place follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing: for euerie place (as I may ſée) excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the other place next before him, by 10.</p>
                           <p>Now (if it pleaſe you) I will returne to my example of Cattell. But I remember you ſaide, I might not adde ſummes of ſundry things togither, and that might I ſée by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>

and ſtill as your number encreaſeth aboue 9, caſt away 9.

whether there be any ſuch like value vnder the nether lyne, and if there bée, you haue well done, and ſo goe from one denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to an other, vnto the ende.</p>

                           <p>Firſte amongeſt the cées I find but two, which make one q euen, therfore there muſt nothing bee vnder the line for them: And amongſte the kewes <gap reason="math">

Next that in the third place, 4 out of 2 wil not be, therfore I ad to that 2, 10, and make it 12 from that I take 4 and there reſteth 8. Then ſaye I farther: 9 in the fourth place, and 1 (whiche I muſt adde for the 10, borrowed before) make 10, that muſt I take from 6: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I canne not, I adde to the 6.10, and then is it 16: from then I take 10, and there reſteth 6. to be written vnder them.

and ſo remaineth noughte, wherefore I write downe a cypher 0. Now haue I done with the ſubtraction: and yet in the groſſe ſumme remayneth 1, whiche I muſt ſette right in the ſame place, in the remayner, and ſo the remayner appeareth to bee lyke vnto the higheſt ſumme of <gap reason="math">

But if the parcelles which you added, be more then two: (as thrée foure, fiue, ſixe, or more) than from your groſſe or totall ſumme ſubtracte firſt one of the percels: and note that newe reſidue. Out of that new reſidue, ſubtract an other of your percels, (whiche you will) and Note that ſecond new reſidue. And if you haue no mo percels added, but three, than is that ſecond new reſidue equall &amp; alike to the thirde parcel, whiche you haue not (as yet) ſubtracted, if you haue wrought wel: both in your firſt Addition, and now in youre ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting.

And ſo in this wiſe, (if you haue foure, fiue, or more parcels) maye you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede to make your ſelfe ſure of your totall ſumme, firſt, by Addition of the ſaide par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, produced and gathered.

And it ſerueth in the ſteade of manye Additions. As for example. When I would know how many are 30 times 48: if I ſhould ad 48, thirtie times, it would be a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g work.

                           <p>So I iudge it beſte, but becauſe that greate ſummes can not be multiplyed, but by the multiplication of digits, therefore I thinke it beſt to ſhewe you firſt the way of multiplying them: As when I ſaye, 8 times 8, or 8 times 9. &amp;c. And as for the ſmall digits vnder 5, it were but follie to teach any rule, ſeing they are ſo eaſie, that euerie childe can doe it.

as you ſée here. Then looke how many eche of them lacketh of 10, and write that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt eche of them,<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> at the end of the lynes, and that is called the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, <gap reason="math">

                           <p>Then doe I looke how much 8 doth differ from 10, and I <gap reason="math">

                           <p>But if you would multiplie any number by 5, marke firſt whether the number be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or odde: and if it be euen take the halfe of it, and write a cipher at the beginning of it, as for example: I would multiplie 2564 by 5, I take the half of it, which is 1282 (as you may know by Mediation) and before it I ſet a cipher, thus, 12820, and this is fiue times 2564.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:2279:91"/>
But remember to reſtore as many ciphers to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> amounting ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me, as you bated before, as in this example: 30200 ſhall be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by 206: I ſhall only take awaye the two ciphers from the greater number, and then multiplie 302 by 206, and afterwarde ad the two cyphers againe.

you multiplie the other ſumme: as if you woulde reduce 20 poundes into ſhillinges, you muſt conſider that in a pound are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded 20 ſhillings, therfore multiplie the one 20 by the other 20, and there will amounte 400, whereby you may knowe, that in 20 pounde are contained 400 ſhillinges.

                           <p>But if you wil reduce Flemmiſh money iuſtly, you muſte reduce it firſt into the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt parte of Engliſhe money that is in that come, as for example. If I would reduce 368 double ſtiuers into Engliſh money, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that a double Stiuer containeth 131 <abbr>d</abbr> 
                              <abbr>q</abbr>, you ſhall firſte looke howe many <abbr>q</abbr> bee in the double Stiuer, and you ſhall finde them 12, therefore multiply the ſumme of the ſtiuers by 13, and then haue you their valew in far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, which is 4784. Nowe if you diuide that by 4, then will there appeare the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of pence: but better it were to diuide it
<pb facs="tcp:2279:106"/>
by 48 (for ſo manye farthings are in 1 ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) and then will the quotient declare the ſumme of the ſhillings.</p>
                           <p>Likewiſe, if you would reduce any ſumme of ſingle ſtyuers into Engliſhe money, you muſt multiply the ſumme firſt by 13, &amp; then haue you a certaine ſumme, which ſumme if you diuide by 8, then wil amount the ſumme of pence: or if you diuide it by 96, the ſumme of ſhillings will appeare.</p>
                           <p>But this marke in al diuiſion, when ye do reduce to bring one denomination into an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">☜</note> if there be any remayner after the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that muſt be named by the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the groſſe ſumme that was diuided: as for example: I woulde bring 254 <abbr>q</abbr> into pence, therefore I do diuide that 254 by 4, for ſo many farthings make 1 penny, and the quotient is 63, whiche is the ſumme of the pence, and then remaineth yet 2, whiche are farthings ſtill, as one maye proue by diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.

ſo much is the ſecond ſumme greater then the fourth.

                              <p>You are deceiued: for one onelye (whiche is the ouermoſte) doeth expreſſe the Numeration: and the denominatour doeth declare the number of partes into whiche the vnit is diuided, as in this example, when I ſay: Diuide a pounde weighte of Golde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene foure men, ſo that the firſte man ſhal haue 2/15 the ſeconde 2/15 the thirde 4/15 and the fourth 6/15.</p>
                              <p>Now do you perceiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> by the denominator (whiche is one in al foure Fractions) it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that the pounde waight ſhoulde be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into ſo manye partes I meane 15, and by the foure ſeuerall numerators is limitted the diuerſe portion that each man ſhold haue, that is, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole is parted into 15, the firſte man ſhall haue 2 of thoſe 15 partes: the ſecond man thrée of them: the third man 4: and the fourth man 6.

                              <p>And hereby you perceiue, that a man can haue no more parts of any thing than it was diuided into, nether yet aptlie ſo many: ſo that
<pb facs="tcp:2279:181"/>
it were vnaptly ſayd: You ſhall haue 15/15. that is xv fiftéene partes of any thing, ſéeing it were better ſayde: You ſhal haue the whole thing.</p>

                              <p>So doth it appeare reaſonablye: for the labour is vaine, to diuide anye thing, and than to applie the Diuiſion to no vſe. And much leſſe reaſonable were it to ſay 16/15: for if the whole be diuided into 15 parts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is not poſſible to take 16 of them, that is to ſay, more than altogither.</p>

                              <p>This is true touching the proper and apte vſe of the name of a Fraction:<note place="margin">☜</note> yet improperlye, and after a vulgare acceptation (for eaſineſſe in worke) both thoſe formes be called Fractions, becauſe they be writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like fractions, although they be none in déede for 15/15, and generally all ſuche other: where the Numerator and Denominator be equal, are not Fractions: but the whole thing with all his partes. And ſo 16/12 is not to be called a fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but a mixt number, of a whole number and a Fraction: for it is as muche, as 1 4/12, that is one whole one, and 4 twelue partes, as ſhall be declared in Reduction.

<pb facs="tcp:2279:182"/>

                              <p>There is cauſe why they ſhal ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, for eaſineſſe in worke, write ſome nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

40 ſo many times in it, as twelue doth contayne vnits, that is to ſay: twelue times.

But now I ſee not how the thirde number in this exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Fractions can contain any of the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer (as it happened in whole nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers) ſéeing it is leſſer than eyther of them.</p>

                              <p>No maruaile if you cannot ſée that thing which is not poſſible to be ſéene of anye man, how the third number in multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Fractions ſhould be greater than anye of the two former Fractions, but yet this may you ſée (which I ſayde) that the thirde number in Fractions ſo multiplyed, doeth beare the ſame proportion to any of the two former fractions, that the other of thoſe 2 fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions doth beare to an vnite, as in your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ⅗ being multiplied by 5/12, doeth make 15/60. Now ſaye I, that 15/60 doeth beare the ſame proportion to ⅗, that 5/12 doth beare to an vnit, as you may in your own forme of examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by coyne trie it. For in an olde Angell are 180 halfe pence, whiche I ſet for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire vnit whoſe parts (according to the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions aforeſayde) are theſe, for 15/60 ſette 45 ob.

for ⅖ take 160 <hi>ob</hi> and for 5/12 put 75 <hi>ob</hi> Nowe doeth 45 beare the ſame proportion to 108 that 75 doeth beare to 180: for 45 is 5/11 of 108, and ſo is 75 alſo 5/12 of 180.

                              <p>Conſider thus, that when a Fraction is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned, as in the former example ⅗, if it bée multiplied by more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 1, it will make more
<pb facs="tcp:2279:187"/>
than one entire number.

Now if I take it but once it cannot be more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was before, that is,<note place="margin">☞</note> 3 <abbr>ſ</abbr>. And if I take it leſſe then once, it cannot be ſo much as it was before. Then ſeeing that a Fraction is leſſe than one, if I multiplie a Fraction by another Fraction, it followeth that I doe take that firſt Fraction leſſe than once and therfore the ſumme that amounteth, muſt néedes be leſſe than the firſt fraction.</p>

                              <p>I haue ſundrie thinges to declare but I haue reſerued them for a priuate booke by it ſelfe, yet notwithſtanding becauſe the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the rate of meaſuring of ground is ſo common that it toucheth all men, and yet no more common than néedefull, but ſo muche corrupt, that it is to farre out of all good rate, not only in the Engliſhe bookes of Statutes commonlye printed, but alſo in the Latine bookes, and in the Frenche alſo, for I haue read of eche ſorte, and conferred them dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, I will giue you a Table for the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe errours, as maye ſuffiſe for this preſent time.

This is that ſtatute: whereby you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that the intent of the Statute is,<note place="margin">An Acre.</note> that one Acre ſhoulde containe 160 ſquare Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.

                              <p>As I perceiue by the wordes of that Statute, a perche to be 1/160 of an Acre, ſo could I make thoſe numbers all in Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

                              <p>So I finde that if the acre holde in breadth xiij perches it ſhall containe in le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth 12 perches, 5 foote, and 1/1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>That is often true, but not generally, as I haue by conference tried diuerſlye: but in this ſtatute the frenche booke is moſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in all other places lightlye.</p>
                              <p>But now to performe my promiſe I will ſet forth the Table for meaſuring of an Acre of ground onely by ſuche partes as the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute doth mention, becauſe at this time I doe of purpoſe write it for the better vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the ſtatute, and hereafter with other thinges I intende to ſet forth this ſame more at large.</p>
                              <p>In this Table following, I haue not done as in the other ſtatute before co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution with the faults crept into the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, but onely haue written that true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which the equitie of the Statute doeth

pretends. For it were to vile to iudge of ſo noble Princes and worthie Councellors, as haue authoriſed &amp; ſet forth this ſtatute, that they would make one acre in any form grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than an other, but euery one to be iuſt and equall with ech other, which is the grounde alſo of my worke, and hereby maye all men perceiue how néedefull Arithmetick is vnto the Studentes of the law.

                              <p>In deede Sir, I vnderſtand the Table (as I thinke) by thoſe other whiche you ſette forth before. For in the firſt Columne is ſet the perches of the breadth of any Acre, and then in the 2 columnes following appeareth how many perches and how many foote the ſame Acre muſt haue for his length</p>

                              <p>You take it well: how be it to ſpeake exactly of breadth &amp; length, the firſt columne doth ſometime betoken the breadth: &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time the length,<note place="margin">☞</note> for properly the longeſt ſide of any ſquare doth limit his length, and the ſhorter ſide doth betoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the breadth, yet it is no great abuſe in ſuch tables, where a man cannot well change the title, to let the name remayne, although the proportions of the numbers doe chaunge: for ſtill by the firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne, is expreſſed the meaſure of the one ſide, and by the two other pillers in one Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne, is ſet forth the meaſure of the other ſide.

                              <p>The forme to vnderſtande the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this queſtion, and all ſuche like, is this:<note place="margin">☞</note> Reduce al the Denominators into one number by Multiplication, except that anye of them be partes of ſome other of them, for al ſuche partes you may ouerpaſſe, and take for them all thoſe numbers, whoſe parts they be: as in this example the ſhares be theſe ⅓ 1/10 ¼ 1/12 ⅙ 1/20 if I multiplie al the Denominatours togither, beginning with 3, and ſo go on vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 20, it will make 144000: but conſidering that 3 is a part of 6, I ſhall ommitte that 3, and likewayes 10, whiche is a part of 20, I maye ouerpaſſe alſo, and then is there but 3 denominatours to multiplie, that is 4, 6, and 20, whiche make 480, whiche ſumme I take for my worke, bycauſe all the Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours wil be founde in it. Then I take ſuche
<pb facs="tcp:2279:222"/>
partes of it as the queſtion importeth, that is for the firſte man, ⅛ 1/10, the ⅓ is 160 the 1/10 is 48: whiche I put in one ſumme for the firſte mans ſhare, and it maketh 208. Then for the ſeconde mans ſhare, I take ¼, whiche is 120, and 1/10. whiche is 48, and that maketh in the whole 168. Now for the thirde man whiche muſte haue ⅙ I take 80 And for the fourth man there remayneth but 24, whiche is 1/20 of the whole ſumme: ſo that if the whole pray had bene but 480 <abbr>lb.</abbr> then were the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion anſwered: but bicauſe the ſumme was of greater value, by this meanes nowe ſhall I know the partition of it. I muſt ſet my nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                                 <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers by the order of the Golden rule, putting in the firſte place the number that I founde by multiplying the Denominatours, and in the ſeconde place the ſumme of the bootie.<note place="margin">The reaſon of this rule.</note> And looke what proportion is betwéene the firſte number and that ſeconde, the ſame proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall be betwéene the partes of that firſt number and the partes of the ſeconde, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring eache to his like.

<pb facs="tcp:2279:225"/>
but in the meane ſeaſon I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde the queſtion as it may be wrought by good poſſibilitie. As if foure men build a houſe togither, and it coſt them 3000 crownes, and then for the partition they agrée thus: that as often as the firſte man doth paye 6 crownes, ſo often the ſeconde ſhall paye foure, the third man 8 and the fourth man thrée. Or els thus: that the firſte man ſhall pay double ſo muche as the fourth, and the ſeconde man ſhall paye ⅔ of the firſte mans charge: the third manne ſhall pay double ſo much as the ſecond: (And theſe two wayes are to one ende) but further for their agréement it is appointed alſo, that the firſte man ſhal giue 6 crownes ouerplus, and the ſeconde 12, and the fourth ſhal giue 20, but the third man ſhal giue no ouerplus, but ſhal haue 8 crownes abated of his charge. Now is the queſtion poſſible to be aſſoyled, and this is the way to doe it. Marke the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the ſeuerall charges,<note place="margin">☜</note> and ſet out ſmall numbers in that rate, by whiche you may reduce the worke to the Golden rule, as here in the firſt forme, the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers are alredie named, 6, 4, 8, 3: and in the ſeconde forme, although they be not plainly named, yet they may be the ſame nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers: for 6 is double to 3,
<pb facs="tcp:2279:226"/>
and 4 is ⅔ of 6: and againe 8 is double to 4. Now adde theſe togither and they make 21, whiche 21 muſt be ſet in the firſt number in the Golden rule: for if it with the ouerplus of eache mans charge woulde make the totall ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the charges, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were thoſe ſeueral ſums the charges of ech man, beſids his ouerplus: but now it is not ſo.</p>

But to returne to our worke. There is a ſeruant that hath boughte of the veluet and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſke for his maiſter 40 yeardes, the veluet at 20 <abbr>ſ</abbr>, a yeard, and the Damaſke at 12 <abbr>ſ</abbr>, &amp;

when he commeth home,<note place="margin">A queſtion of vvares.</note> his maiſter deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of him howe muche he hath boughte of ech ſort: I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not tel (ſaith he) exactlie, but this I knowe, that I paide for damaſk 48 <abbr>ſ</abbr>. more than I paide for veluet, nowe muſt you geſſe how manie yeardes there is of each ſort.</p>

                              <p>Although the geſſe ſéemeth difficulte, yet I wil proue what I can do: for I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber your ſaying, that it forceth not how fonde or falſe the geſſe be, ſo it be ſomewhat to the queſtion, and not an anſwere of a contrarie matter.</p>
                              <p>Therefore firſt I imagine that he boughte 20 yeardes of Damaſke, for which he ſhould paye after the former price 240 ſhillings: then muſte he néedes haue of veluet other 20 yeardes (to make vp the 40 yeardes) and that woulde coſte 400 <abbr>ſ</abbr>. So that the total of the price of the damaſke is leſſe than the ſumme paide for veluet 160 <abbr>ſ</abbr>, and ſhould be more by 48. therefore the firſt errour is 208 too little. Then begin I again, and ſuppoſe he boughte of Damaſke 30 yeardes that coſt 360 <abbr>ſ</abbr>, then had he but 10 yeardes of Veluet, which coſte 200 <abbr>ſ</abbr>: and nowe the price of Damaſke is greater than the price of the Veluet by 160
<pb facs="tcp:2279:249"/>
ſhillings, and ſhoulde be but 48, therefore is the ſecond erroure 112 too muche, whiche I ſette in forme of a figure as here doeth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. Then doe I <gap reason="math">

And in as muche as the ſignes of the errours be vnlike, I knowe I muſte worke by Addition, therefore adde I thoſe two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals togither, and they make 8480, whiche is the diuidend: then adde I alſo the two errors togither. 208 and 112, and they make 320, whiche is the diuiſor. Wherefore diuiding 8480, by 320, the quotient wil be. 26 ½, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is the true ſumme of yeards of Damaſke that he boughte: and in Veluet 13 yeardes ½, and that appeared by examination thus: 26 ½ yeardes of Damaſke at 12 <abbr>ſ</abbr>. the yeard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth 318 <abbr>ſ</abbr>, then in Veluet he hadde but 13 yeards and ½. that coſt 270 <abbr>ſ</abbr> at 20 <abbr>ſ</abbr>. y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yeard.

And there vppon cauſed twoo maſſie péeces, one of golde, and an other of ſiluer to be prepared of the ſame weight that the ſaide Crowne was of: and conſidering that golde is heauier of nature than ſiluer, and therfore golde of like waight with ſiluer, muſt néedes occupie leſſe roume, by reaſon it is more compact &amp; ſound in ſubſtance, he was aſſured, that putting the maſſe of golde into a veſſel brimme full of water, there would not ſo much water run ouer, as when he ſhoulde putte in the ſiluer maſſe of the like weight. Wherefore he tried both, &amp; noted not onelye the quantities of the water at eche time, but alſo the difference or exceſſe of the one aboue the other, wherby he learned what proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in quantitie is betwéene gold and ſiluer of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall waight. And then putting the crown it ſelf into the veſſell of water brimme full (as before) marked how much water did run out

then, &amp; comparing it with the water that ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out when the gold was put in, noted howe much it did excéede that: &amp; likewiſe compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it to the water that ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the ſiluer, marked how much it was leſſe than that: &amp; by thoſe proportions found out the iuſt qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                              <p>I perceiue your meaning, and conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture your imagination to be thus: that if you knewe the exacte proportion betwéene Gold and Siluer and Water both in theyr waight and quantities, then coulde you ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilie finde out the mixtures of them, whiche thing I haue reſerued for an other worke that intreateth ſuch matters ſpeciallie. And at this time you muſte conſider, that you learne Arithmetike, which intreateth of the maner to ſolue doubtful queſtions touching number, without regarde what matter is ſignifyed by that number, elſe were it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie in Arithmetike to teach all arts, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it may be moued queſtions of al arts. But ſeeing you are ſo deſirous to know this thing, I wil tell it you in ſuche a ſorte, that you ſhall practiſe your arte in finding it, and propounde it in forme of a queſtion. Gold

But to help you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in this riddle, you ſhall note that the proportion of quicke ſiluer vnto water, is the iuſt middle number proportionall in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion Geometricall, betweene the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Gold and ſiluer vnto water. And his proportion is as 29<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now if you wil know the iuſt numbers of theſe 3 proportions then muſt you finde out 3 numbers in Progreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on geometrical, wherof the middlemoſt muſt be 290/21, and the firſt muſt be vnto the laſt, as 25 to 48.

to take two maſſes of golde and ſiluer equall in waight with the crowne, for the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might as wel be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in any other waight yea althoughe the maſſe of golde were of one waight and the maſſe of ſiluer of another. As for example. If the crowne were of 8 pounde waighte, as I did ſuppoſe, and I haue not ſo muche other fine golde, but onely 1 <abbr>lb</abbr>, and trying that by water, &amp; finding that it doth expell but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſo is it, as good as if the 3 maſſes were al of one weight. And thus for this time I wil make an end of this other part of Arithmetike.</p>
